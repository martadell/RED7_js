# Key project 02: Card Game in Javascript
RED7 Cards game library in JavaScript

This project consist of a JavaScript library taht represents RED7 card game. You can find the original game rules <a href="https://github.com/martadell/RED7_js/blob/master/src/Red7Rules.pdf">here</a>.

This is a simplified* version of the actual game. The game ends when there is only one player left (and this one becomes
the winner of the game). Apart from the color rules, I have implemented the action rules aswell, but theese are not available in the random demo because since the game requires a lot of user interaction I couldn't simulate it with random numbers al the time (also the game ends really fast if you keep playing random cards because each round the player has to win).

*Does not include the point scoring system as mentioned. It doesn't include teh advanced rule aswell (When you discard a card to the Canvas, if the number on that card is higher than the total number of cards in your Palette, you may draw an additional card from the Draw Deck (unless the Draw Deck is empty)).
